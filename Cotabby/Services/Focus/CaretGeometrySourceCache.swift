/// File overview:
/// Remembers the AX leaf elements that produced caret geometry for the currently focused field so
/// the resolver can re-read them directly instead of re-discovering them with a fresh tree walk on
/// every keystroke.
///
/// Why this exists: in Chromium editors the caret rect comes from per-line `AXStaticText` leaves,
/// and finding them means a bounded-but-real BFS (`collectStaticTextRuns`) on each focus poll. The
/// leaf *elements* are stable across keystrokes within a field even though their text and frames
/// change, so caching the element references turns the per-keystroke crawl into a handful of
/// attribute reads. The cache is intentionally a reference type: the resolvers are value-type
/// structs, so their own state cannot survive across calls.
///
/// Correctness contract: the cache is keyed by `(container identity, focusChangeSequence)`. The
/// sequence is the authoritative field-switch signal (`elementIdentifier` alone is `CFHash`-based
/// and can collide across recycled nodes), so a key match guarantees "same field, same focus." Even
/// on a match, callers must re-validate the cached elements before trusting them — a stale element
/// read simply misses and forces a re-walk.
