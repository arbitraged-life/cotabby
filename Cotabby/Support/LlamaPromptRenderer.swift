/// Renders the prompts consumed by the local llama runtime, in two shapes: `prompt(...)` for the
/// raw single-string path (base / no-template models) and `messages(...)` for the chat-template
/// path (instruct models that ship a template). Both are plain prose with no standalone `Label:`
/// lines, because small instruct models echo a bare label line straight into the ghost text.
///
/// Why this file exists:
/// llama.cpp does not give us a separate "instructions" channel the way Foundation Models does.
/// That means all base behavior, user preferences, and request context must be composed by us.
/// Keeping that composition isolated here prevents prompt policy from leaking into
/// `SuggestionRequestFactory` or the runtime lifecycle layer.
