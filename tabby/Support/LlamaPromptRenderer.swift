/// llama.cpp does not give us a separate "instructions" channel the way Foundation Models does.
/// That means all base behavior, user preferences, and request context must be composed into one
/// prompt string. Keeping that composition isolated here prevents prompt policy from leaking into
/// `SuggestionRequestFactory` or the runtime lifecycle layer.

    /// real product experience.
